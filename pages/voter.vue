      Lodgement of a proxy appointment by a securityholder does not prevent that securityholder from attending the Annual General Meeting. Therefore, if after lodging the proxy appointment the securityholder decides to attend the Annual General Meeting, while the securityholder is present in the meeting the authority of the appointed proxy to speak and vote on the securityholder's behalf, is suspended.
